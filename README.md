A live demo can be found [here](https://jsudron.github.io/Nordic-Discover-Project/).

## Introduction

For this project I was tasked with creating an application for a travel company called Nordic Discovery. The application allows users to search for a variety of locations within
destinations in Scandinavia & Iceland. These include options for accomodation, restaurants, tourist attractions etc. This gives users a one-stop shop in finding the array of options available
to them in the location selected. Tourism in Scandanavia & Iceland has been steadily increasing over the past few years & this site should help to increase that even further by helping users plan 
their dream holiday up north. 

## UX
 
### Goals

To allow users to find a variety of accomodation/attractions within any location in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway & Sweden.

#### Target audience

- Holidaymakers of all ages looking for potential holiday destinations.
- Holidaymakers whom have already have a holiday booked to Scandinavia or Iceland.
- Students between 18 & 28 looking for somewhere to go on a gap year.

#### Customer goals

- Have a fully proficient & intuitive website.
- Reach a variety of new customers.
- Gain advertising/sponsorship from accomodation/attractions found on the site.

### User Stories

#### Travel company

- Have an attractive & fast website which will keep users engaged.
- Provide a pleasant user experience so users continue to visit the site.
- Enable users to easily find a variety of accomodation/attractions within their desired location.
- Help to increase turnover at attractions so they'll actively advertise Nordic Discovery, e.g. via their own website.
- In the future to drive revenue via sponsorship & advertising from searched locations & accomodation/attractions.
- Allow users & accomodation/attractions to contact the site should they have any enquiries.
- Showcase user testimonials to enhance the legitimacy of the website.

#### UX designer

- Track user behaviour to continue to enhance the user experience.
- Provide a website which is attractive, yet can easily be modified as per the travel companies request.
- Ensure the functionality of the website provides the results required by the user.
- Provide a means for the user to contact the travel company.

#### Users & Customers(accomodation/attractions)

- Find a variety of accomodation/attractions within a desired location on one website.
- Be able to easily contact the travel company for any issues or enquiries.
- Be provided with the contact details for any accomodation/attractions searched for.
- Find accomodation/attractions that may not have found without directly knowing the name of the place looking for.
- Customers will be looking to increase the number of visitors.
- The towns & cities will look to increase tourist numbers which will drive revenue in the area.
- Users may find accomodation/attractions which would ordinarily only be found further down Google searches.

### Design

#### Colours

- #FAED26 Yellow
- #FFFFFF White
- #09191D Dark Blue

The website [Coolors] (https://coolors.co/) was used to find an attractive colour scheme which compliments Scandinavia & Iceland.
The dark blue compliments the background image used but also contrasts against the white & yellow which helps the text to pop out against the
background. The colours are clean & simple much like Scandinavian design whilst also mimicking the beautiful starry nights the area
is well known for. 

#### Font

### Scope 

Contact Aberdeen has run club nights before with DJ Jonny Kennedy heading these up. However, having been out of the scene for some time we wanted
to give club owners a glimpse into what Contact club nights are all about. We also wanted to use the site as a platform for DJs to get in touch
should they want to perform at a Contact club night. Therefore providing an easy means of contact on the site was a must.
