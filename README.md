A live demo can be found [here](https://jsudron.github.io/Nordic-Discover-Project/).

## Introduction

For this project I was tasked with creating an application for a travel company called Nordic Discovery. The application allows users to search for a variety of locations within
destinations in Scandinavia & Iceland. These include options for accomodation, restaurants, tourist attractions etc. The aim is to give users a one-stop shop in finding the array of options available
to them in the location selected. Tourism in Scandanavia & Iceland has been steadily increasing over the past few years & this site should help to increase that even further by helping users plan 
their dream holiday up north.

### Scope 

Contact Aberdeen has run club nights before with DJ Jonny Kennedy heading these up. However, having been out of the scene for some time we wanted
to give club owners a glimpse into what Contact club nights are all about. We also wanted to use the site as a platform for DJs to get in touch
should they want to perform at a Contact club night. Therefore providing an easy means of contact on the site was a must.
